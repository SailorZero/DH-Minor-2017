This project was made during the course of Digital Humanities at HSE by four bachelor students, 
Ustinia Kosheleva, Anna Kondratjeva, Daria Maximova and Yevgeniy Lapin.

They compared two scripts of the Hannibal Story, 
one by David Mamet (1999) and the other by Steven Zaillian (2000).

They extracted social networks from the scripts and visualised them in Gephi. 
You may find the visualisation in the .gexf format as well as the presentation for this project in PDF.
