This project was made during the DH Course by two bachelor students, Kolganov Artyom and Konyaev Maksim.
They were interesred in the distinction of slave charachters in the anient Greek tragedy 
and found some quantitative parameters that distinguish slave charachters from the rest. 
The students analysed six Greek plays and extracted social networks. 
The networks were visualised in Gephi, you may find all of them in the .gexf format. 
There is also the presentation for the project in PDF.
