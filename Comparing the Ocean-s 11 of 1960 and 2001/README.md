This project was created by two bachelor students Liubov Gerasenko and Varvara Rodchina during the DH Course.
In this project the students compared the social networks, built for two screen versions of the Ocean's 11.
The first movie was released in 1960 and the second in 2001. The networks were visualised in Gephi.
Here you may find the social networks in the .gexf format and the presentation of the project in PDF.
