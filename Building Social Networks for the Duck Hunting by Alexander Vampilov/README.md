This project was made during our DH Course at HSE by Anna Derevnjak, 
a second-year bachelor student at the School of History.
In this project Anna compared two versions of the social networks for the play called "Duck Hunting", 
written by a russian author Alexander Vampilov in 1970.

The first social network was built based on the appearances of the characters in the same scene, 
while the second network represents their direct interaction.

The both network visualisations are provided in the .gexf format. Here you may also find the presentation in PDF.
