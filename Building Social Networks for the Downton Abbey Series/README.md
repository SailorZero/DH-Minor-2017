The goal of this project was to visualise the relationships of the characters of the Downton Abbey Episodes.
The project was completed by Anton Basov during the Digital Humanities Course at HSE.

Here you may find the visualisations for the first seven episodes of the first season. 
All the graphs were made in Gephi. There are also the slides for the project in the folder.
